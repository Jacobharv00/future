> A website that I created to mimic what a real companies website might look like. The main goal for this project was to practice my CSS before attending Flatiron School and make a responsive website. The tech I used for this was HTML, CSS, and a pinch on JavaScript. Some challenges I faced while building this application was using media-screen queries in the CSS file. In the future I hope to implement real links in the footer.
